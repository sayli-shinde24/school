            <p>The school follows the curriculum developed by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations for Pre-school, Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary levels.</p>

              <p>It has been designed to achieve the national goals of education in general and to provide quality education to all.</p>

              <p>It has been designed to address the needs of various stakeholders.

                  It provides a strong foundation in the early classes. The skills, attitudes and knowledge that children acquire in elementary school lay the groundwork for success in the future.</p>
              
              <p>The present Curriculum for Pre-school to Class VIII has been designed and developed to provide a holistic and broad-based education, that will help realise not only the inherent potential of children but also equip them with the skills and competencies necessary for the 21st Century. The well charted curriculum enables TPS to be in the list of best ICSE schools in Mumbai.</p>

                  <p>Inculcating essential human values and developing core life skills among children right from early classes is one of the major goals of the present curriculum. In the curriculum, such values and life skills have been integrated suitably within and across the subjects and presented in an infused manner so that these values and life skills could be imbibed as a way of life. Thus, overall, we are one of the few schools with good ICSE results</p>
