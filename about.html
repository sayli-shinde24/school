            <p>It has been the endeavour of the Thakur Educational Group to create a niche and it's own stamp of quality which has won the pride of place in society and has worked towards making academic life, a happy journey full of joy and wonder. As educators and mentors it becomes the vision and duty of all engaged in imparting education to lay the foundations for a strong generation of young men and women that will lead our great nation to magnificence and glory.</p>

            <p>It gives me immense pride that Thakur Public School has been taking great strides towards becoming the premier institution for academic excellence and the all round growth and development of young minds and intellects.

            I extend my warm wishes to all the members at Thakur Public School for their contribution on this journey of continued progress and excellence.</p>
